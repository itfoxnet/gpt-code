        I understand you want to generate a code for an app that matches a specific screenshot or reference web page, but I need to have the image or description of the web page you have in mind. Please provide a screenshot or details about the elements, style, and layout you'd like to replicate in the app. This will help me generate the appropriate HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JS code for you.
